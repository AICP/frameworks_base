This XML defines an allowlist of packages that should be exempt from ECM (Enhanced Confirmation
Mode).

Example usage:

    <enhanced-confirmation-trusted-package
         package="com.example.app"
         sha256-cert-digest="E9:7A:BC:2C:D1:CA:8D:58:6A:57:0B:8C:F8:60:AA:D2:8D:13:30:2A:FB:C9:00:2C:5D:53:B2:6C:09:A4:85:A0"/>

    ...

    <enhanced-confirmation-trusted-installer
         package="com.example.installer"
         sha256-cert-digest="E9:7A:BC:2C:D1:CA:8D:58:6A:57:0B:8C:F8:60:AA:D2:8D:13:30:2A:FB:C9:00:2C:5D:53:B2:6C:09:A4:85:A0"/>

    ...

The "enhanced-confirmation-trusted-package" entry shown above indicates that "com.example.app"
should be considered a "trusted package". A "trusted package" will be exempt from ECM restrictions.

The "enhanced-confirmation-trusted-installer" entry shown above indicates that
"com.example.installer" should be considered a "trusted installer". A "trusted installer", and all
packages that it installs, will be exempt from ECM restrictions. (There are some exceptions to this.
For example, a trusted installer, at the time of installing an app, can opt the app back in to ECM
restrictions by setting the app's package source to PackageInstaller.PACKAGE_SOURCE_DOWNLOADED_FILE
or PackageInstaller.PACKAGE_SOURCE_LOCAL_FILE.)

In either case:

- The "package" XML attribute refers to the app's package name.
- The "sha256-cert-digest" XML attribute refers to the SHA-256 hash of an app signing certificate.

For any entry to successfully apply to a package, both XML attributes must be present, and must
match the package. That is, the package name must match the "package" attribute, and the app must be
signed by the signing certificate identified by the "sha256-cert-digest" attribute..
