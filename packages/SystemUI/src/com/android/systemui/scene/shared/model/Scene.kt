/**
 * Defines interface for classes that can describe a "scene".
 *
 * In the scene framework, there can be multiple scenes in a single scene "container". The container
 * takes care of rendering the current scene and allowing scenes to be switched from one to another
 * based on either user action (for example, swiping down while on the lock screen scene may switch
 * to the shade scene).

     * Returns a mapping between [UserAction] and flows that emit a [SceneModel].
     *
     * When the scene framework detects the user action, it starts a transition to the scene
     * described by the latest value in the flow that's mapped from that user action.
     *
     * Once the [Scene] becomes the current one, the scene framework will invoke this method and set
     * up collectors to watch for new values emitted to each of the flows. If a value is added to
     * the map at a given [UserAction], the framework will set up user input handling for that
     * [UserAction] and, if such a user action is detected, the framework will initiate a transition
     * to that [SceneModel].
     *
     * Note that calling this method does _not_ mean that the given user action has occurred.
     * Instead, the method is called before any user action/gesture is detected so that the
     * framework can decide whether to set up gesture/input detectors/listeners for that type of
     * user action.
     *
     * Note that a missing value for a specific [UserAction] means that the user action of the given
     * type is not currently active in the scene and should be ignored by the framework, while the
     * current scene is this one.
     *
     * The API is designed such that it's possible to emit ever-changing values for each
     * [UserAction] to enable, disable, or change the destination scene of a given user action.
