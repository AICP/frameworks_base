This XML defines an allowlist for packages that want to join a particular shared-uid.
If a non-system package that is signed with platform signature, is trying to join a particular
shared-uid, and not in this list, the installation will fail.

- The "package" XML attribute refers to the app's package name.
- The "shareduid" XML attribute refers to the shared uid name.

Example usage
    1. <allow-package-shareduid package="com.example.app" shareduid="android.uid.system"/>
        Indicates that a package - com.example.app, will be able to join android.uid.system.
    2. <allow-package-shareduid package="oem.example.app" shareduid="oem.uid.custom"/>
        Indicates that a package - oem.example.app, will be able to join oem.uid.custom.
