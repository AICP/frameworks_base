## Touchpad ##

# After the DualShock 4 has been connected over Bluetooth for a minute or so,
# its reports start bunching up in time, meaning that we receive 2â€“4 reports
# within a millisecond followed by a >10ms wait until the next batch.
#
# This uneven timing causes the apparent speed of a finger (calculated using
# time deltas between received reports) to vary dramatically even if it's
# actually moving smoothly across the touchpad, triggering the touchpad stack's
# drumroll detection logic. For moving fingers, the drumroll detection logic
# splits the finger's single movement into many small movements of consecutive
# touches, which are then inhibited by the click wiggle filter. For tapping
# fingers, it prevents tapping to click because it thinks the finger's moving
# too fast.
#
# Since this touchpad doesn't seem to have to drumroll issues, we can safely
# disable drumroll detection.
gestureProp.Drumroll_Suppression_Enable = 0

# Because of the way this touchpad is positioned, touches around the edges are
# no more likely to be palms than ones in the middle, so remove the edge zones
# from the palm classifier to increase the usable area of the pad.
