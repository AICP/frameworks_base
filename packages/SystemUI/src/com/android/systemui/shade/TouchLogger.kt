/**
 * A logger for tracking touch dispatching in the shade view hierarchy. The purpose of this logger
 * is to passively observe dispatchTouchEvent calls in order to see which subtrees of the shade are
 * handling touches. Additionally, some touches may be passively observed for views near the top of
 * the shade hierarchy that cannot intercept touches, i.e. scrims. The usage of static methods for
 * logging is sub-optimal in many ways, but it was selected in this case to make usage of this
 * non-function diagnostic code as low friction as possible.
