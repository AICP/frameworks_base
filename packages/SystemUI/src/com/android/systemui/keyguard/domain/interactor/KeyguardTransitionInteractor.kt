     * WARNING: This will NOT emit a value if a transition is CANCELED, and will also not emit a
     * value when a subsequent transition is STARTED. It will *only* emit once we have finally
     * FINISHED in a state. This can have unintuitive implications.
     *
     * For example, if we're transitioning from GONE -> DOZING, and that transition is CANCELED in
     * favor of a DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN transition, the FINISHED state is still GONE, and will remain
     * GONE throughout the DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN transition until the DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN transition
     * finishes (at which point we'll be FINISHED in LOCKSCREEN).
     *
     * Since there's no real limit to how many consecutive transitions can be canceled, it's even
     * possible for the FINISHED state to be the same as the STARTED state while still
     * transitioning.
     *
     * For example:
     * 1. We're finished in GONE.
     * 2. The user presses the power button, starting a GONE -> DOZING transition. We're still
     *    FINISHED in GONE.
     * 3. The user changes their mind, pressing the power button to wake up; this starts a DOZING ->
     *    LOCKSCREEN transition. We're still FINISHED in GONE.
     * 4. The user quickly swipes away the lockscreen prior to DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN finishing; this
     *    starts a LOCKSCREEN -> GONE transition. We're still FINISHED in GONE, but we've also
     *    STARTED a transition *to* GONE.
     * 5. We'll emit KeyguardState.GONE again once the transition finishes.
     *
     * If you just need to know when we eventually settle into a state, this flow is likely
     * sufficient. However, if you're having issues with state *during* transitions started after
     * one or more canceled transitions, you probably need to use [currentKeyguardState].
     */

    /**
     * The [KeyguardState] we're currently in.
     *
     * If we're not in transition, this is simply the [finishedKeyguardState]. If we're in
     * transition, this is the state we're transitioning *from*.
     *
     * Absent CANCELED transitions, [currentKeyguardState] and [finishedKeyguardState] are always
     * identical - if a transition FINISHES in a given state, the subsequent state we START a
     * transition *from* would always be that same previously FINISHED state.
     *
     * However, if a transition is CANCELED, the next transition will START from a state we never
     * FINISHED in. For example, if we transition from GONE -> DOZING, but CANCEL that transition in
     * favor of DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN, we've STARTED a transition *from* DOZING despite never
     * FINISHING in DOZING. Thus, the current state will be DOZING but the FINISHED state will still
     * be GONE.
     *
     * In this example, if there was DOZING-related state that needs to be set up in order to
     * properly render a DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN transition, it would never be set up if we were
     * listening for [finishedKeyguardState] to emit DOZING. However, [currentKeyguardState] would
     * emit DOZING immediately upon STARTING DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN, allowing us to set up the state.
     *
     * Whether you want to use [currentKeyguardState] or [finishedKeyguardState] depends on your
     * specific use case and how you want to handle cancellations. In general, if you're dealing
     * with state/UI present across multiple [KeyguardState]s, you probably want
     * [currentKeyguardState]. If you're dealing with state/UI encapsulated within a single state,
     * you likely want [finishedKeyguardState].
     *
     * As an example, let's say you want to animate in a message on the lockscreen UI after waking
     * up, and that TextView is not involved in animations between states. You'd want to collect
     * [finishedKeyguardState], so you'll only animate it in once we're settled on the lockscreen.
     * If you use [currentKeyguardState] in this case, a DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN transition that is
     * interrupted by a LOCKSCREEN -> GONE transition would cause the message to become visible
     * immediately upon LOCKSCREEN -> GONE STARTING, as the current state would become LOCKSCREEN in
     * that case. That's likely not what you want.
     *
     * On the other hand, let's say you're animating the smartspace from alpha 0f to 1f during
     * DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN, but the transition is interrupted by LOCKSCREEN -> GONE. LS -> GONE
     * needs the smartspace to be alpha=1f so that it can play the shared-element unlock animation.
     * In this case, we'd want to collect [currentKeyguardState] and ensure the smartspace is
     * visible when the current state is LOCKSCREEN. If you use [finishedKeyguardState] in this
     * case, the smartspace will never be set to alpha = 1f and you'll have a half-faded smartspace
     * during the LS -> GONE transition.
     *
     * If you need special-case handling for cancellations (such as conditional handling depending
     * on which [KeyguardState] was canceled) you can collect [canceledKeyguardTransitionStep]
     * directly.
     *
     * As a helpful footnote, here's the values of [finishedKeyguardState] and
     * [currentKeyguardState] during a sequence with two cancellations:
     * 1. We're FINISHED in GONE. currentKeyguardState=GONE; finishedKeyguardState=GONE.
     * 2. We START a transition from GONE -> DOZING. currentKeyguardState=GONE;
     *    finishedKeyguardState=GONE.
     * 3. We CANCEL this transition and START a transition from DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN.
     *    currentKeyguardState=DOZING; finishedKeyguardState=GONE.
     * 4. We subsequently also CANCEL DOZING -> LOCKSCREEN and START LOCKSCREEN -> GONE.
     *    currentKeyguardState=LOCKSCREEN finishedKeyguardState=GONE.
     * 5. LOCKSCREEN -> GONE is allowed to FINISH. currentKeyguardState=GONE;
     *    finishedKeyguardState=GONE.
